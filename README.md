# Imagegrabber

A neat little chrome extension that downloads *<span style='color:blue;'>hangouts</span>* and *bing* wallpapers.

#Why?

because I am too lazy to press ctrl+shift+j -> resources->images-> download->save , and also I was having nothing to pass time :) .

#Usage

You can add it to chrome by going to extensions -> load unpacked extension -> choose folder name containing all these files , cheers !

click the button wallpaper.get() in the popup<br/> <br/>

**Click only after the page has loaded completely ** 

#TODO's:-
 * show users a preview of the image they are downloading using chrome.runtime message passing 
 * generalize this to any website having images, cheers !
 * a workaround if users click the extension before the scripts in the page finish loading ( needed especially for hangouts !)
 

#bonus 
 Take a look at my imgur gallery having tons of images I collected using imagegrabber
